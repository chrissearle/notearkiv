## TODO

### Search

Search is now running using elasticsearch (a proper search engine). However - I've not had time to look at matching - so:

* Match is whole word - not prefix
* Match is based on token - e.g. search for Stanford, Charles Villiers (1852-1924) will match Stanford, Charles Villiers (1852-1924) but also Stanford, Charles and Villiers

### Other

* Sorting of tables (js) and lists (session)
* Dropbox admin - files (link is coded)
* File upload
