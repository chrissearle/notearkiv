## TODO

* Sorting of tables should now work. It seems to have an issue on page load where the arrows don't appear. A refresh makes it work. Don't know why yet.
* Sorting of tables is saved in the browser based on URL and table ID - so returning to the same page should give the same sort.
* Sorting serverside is not currently in use - it will be needed if we need next/prev buttons on show. If this can be avoided then the system will perform a lot better than otherwise.
* Dropbox admin - files (link is coded)
* File upload
* Validation messages etc
