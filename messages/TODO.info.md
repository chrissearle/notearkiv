## TODO

### Search

Search is now running using elasticsearch (a proper search engine).

Note that prefix search is currently not in use.

Note to Chris - why does typeahead need both a search and a db lookup? We want to get rid of all of that - move this to ES too.

### Other

* Sorting of tables (js) and lists (session)
* Dropbox admin - files (link is coded)
* File upload
* Validation messages, created/updated messages etc
